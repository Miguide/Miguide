Decisions are the bedrock of humanity,and can make or unmake people.More importantly, educational decisions
are very fundemental to an individuals success in life.Making terrible educational choices can affect ones outlook to life,work productivity and general fulfillment. 
Miguide is a platform seeking to solve this issue by being a personal Guide to students right in the learning stages.
By providing relevant suggestions to students,Miguide seeks to help people make better educational choices.This we believe is the little quota we can offer,in helping to make people more fulfilled,productive,and happy later in life.

This version is built for senior high school students and the process is fairly simple.

#Process

1.Students sign up for the service and fill in necessary details.

2.They go through the service which is a relatively intuitive and simple flow.

3.In the flow,students are evaluated based on interests,subject preferences,dream job and a brief psych analysis. These metrics are then
computed to give the final results,thus the suggestions for which educational choice may best suit a particular student.


#The Team
Miguide is currently being developed actively by a three member team,with an additional supporting member.
